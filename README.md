├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── styles.css      # All styling and responsive design
├── script.js       # Interactive functionality
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Setup

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. No build process or dependencies required - it's pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Customization

### Update Phone Number
Search and replace `(855) 400-1090` throughout the files with your actual phone number.

### Update Counter Numbers
In `script.js`, update the counter values:
```javascript
const familiesMoved = 1000;  // Update with actual number
const recentBookings = 12;   // Update with actual number
```

### Update Logo
The logo is currently loaded from your WordPress site. To use a local logo:
1. Add your logo file to the project folder
2. Update the logo `src` in `index.html`:
```html
<img src="your-logo.png" alt="Perfectly Fast Moving Logo">
```

### Form Submission
Currently, the form shows an alert on submission. To connect to a backend:

1. Update the form submission handler in `script.js`
2. Replace the alert with an API call to your backend
3. Add proper error handling and success messages

Example:
```javascript
quoteForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(quoteForm);
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/quote', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });
        // Handle response
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle error
    }
});
```
